<h2>Devconnector 2.0</h2>
<p>Such is the nature of software; things change frequently, newer more robust paradigms emerge and packages are continuously evolving. Hopefully the below will help you adjust your course code to manage the most notable changes.

The master branch of this repository contains all the changes and updates, so if you're following along with the lectures in the Udemy course and need reference code to compare against please checkout the origionalcoursecode branch. Much of the code in this master branch is compatible with course code but be aware that if you adopt some of the changes here, it may require other changes too.

After completing the course you may want to look through this branch and play about with the changes.</p>
